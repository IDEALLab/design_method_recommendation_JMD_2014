=====================================

Experiment code for our 2014 Journal of Mechanical Design paper - "Machine Learning Algorithms for Recommending Design Methods"

To replicate paper experiments, run the following from any python (2.7) prompt: python paper_experiments.py

You will also need to download the HCD Connect Case Study data, located here:

Place this inside a 'data' folder, or alter the 'data_path' variable in the paper_experiments.py file
